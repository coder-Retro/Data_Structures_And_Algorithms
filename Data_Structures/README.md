# 🏗️ Data Structures

> **"A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed, modified, and processed efficiently."**

Choosing the right data structure is one of the most important decisions in software development. Different structures are optimized for different tasks—some provide fast searching, others excel at insertions, while some are designed for hierarchical or networked data.

This section introduces the fundamental data structures used throughout computer science and demonstrates how each one solves a different class of problems.

Other specialized choices include:

* **Heap** → Efficient priority management.
* **Hashing** → Extremely fast key-based lookup.
* **Linked List** → Frequent insertions and deletions.
