# 📗 Vector

`std::vector` is the most commonly used container in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It represents a **dynamic array**, allowing elements to be added or removed while automatically managing memory.

Unlike a traditional array, a vector grows and shrinks as needed, making it a flexible and efficient choice for most programming tasks.

# 📄 File Overview

## `vector.cpp`

Introduces the fundamentals of `std::vector`.

Topics include:

* Declaration
* Initialization
* Accessing elements
* Traversing vectors
* Common member functions
* Insertion and deletion
* Iterators

This file is intended as the starting point for understanding dynamic arrays in C++.

## `dynamicVector.cpp`

Focuses on how vectors manage memory dynamically.

Topics include:

* Automatic resizing
* Capacity growth
* Memory allocation
* Performance considerations
* Reserving capacity

This example helps explain one of the biggest advantages of vectors over traditional arrays.

# ⚡ Common Operations

| Operation           |     Complexity |
| ------------------- | -------------: |
| Access by index     |           O(1) |
| `push_back()`       | O(1) amortized |
| `pop_back()`        |           O(1) |
| Insert at beginning |           O(n) |
| Insert in middle    |           O(n) |
| Erase               |           O(n) |
| Search              |           O(n) |

# 💡 When Should You Use a Vector?

Use a vector when:

* The number of elements is not known beforehand.
* Fast random access is required.
* Most insertions happen at the end.
* Simplicity and performance are both important.

Avoid using a vector when frequent insertions or deletions occur at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence.

# 🌍 Real-World Applications

Vectors are widely used in:

* Competitive programming
* Game development
* Data processing
* Scientific computing
* Machine learning
* General-purpose software development

For many applications, `std::vector` is the default container of choice.
