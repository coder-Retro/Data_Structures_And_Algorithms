# 👑 Priority Queue

`std::priority_queue` is a **container adapter** provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Unlike a regular queue, which processes elements in the order they are inserted (**FIFO**), a priority queue processes elements based on their **priority**.

By default, the element with the **highest value** has the highest priority and is removed first. Internally, `std::priority_queue` is typically implemented using a **binary heap**, making insertion and removal operations highly efficient.

# 📖 Prerequisites

Before studying this topic, you should be familiar with:

* Basic C++ syntax
* STL Containers
* Queue
* Binary Trees (recommended)
* Heap (recommended)

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should be able to:

* Understand how a priority queue differs from a regular queue.
* Create and initialize a `std::priority_queue`.
* Insert and remove elements efficiently.
* Build both Max Heaps and Min Heaps.
* Use custom comparators for user-defined priorities.
* Recognize problems where a priority queue is the ideal solution.

# 📄 File Overview

## `priorityqueue.cpp`

This file introduces the core functionality of `std::priority_queue`.

### Topics Covered

* Creating a priority queue
* `push()`
* `pop()`
* `top()`
* `size()`
* `empty()`
* Max Heap (default behavior)
* Min Heap using `std::greater<>`
* Priority-based element retrieval

The examples demonstrate how elements are automatically ordered based on priority rather than insertion order.

# ⚡ Common Operations

| Operation | Complexity |
| --------- | ---------: |
| `push()`  |   O(log n) |
| `pop()`   |   O(log n) |
| `top()`   |       O(1) |
| `size()`  |       O(1) |
| `empty()` |       O(1) |

# 🔍 Queue vs Priority Queue

| Feature              |     Queue     |         Priority Queue         |
| -------------------- | :-----------: | :----------------------------: |
| Order                |      FIFO     |     Highest Priority First     |
| Removal              | Front Element |    Highest Priority Element    |
| Underlying Structure |     Deque     |           Binary Heap          |
| `top()` / `front()`  |     Front     |        Highest Priority        |
| Common Complexity    |      O(1)     | O(log n) for insertion/removal |

# 💡 Max Heap vs Min Heap

### Max Heap (Default)

The largest element has the highest priority.

Example:

```text
Insert: 10, 50, 20, 30

Removal Order:
50
30
20
10
```

---

### Min Heap

The smallest element has the highest priority.

Example:

```text
Insert: 10, 50, 20, 30

Removal Order:
10
20
30
50
```

# 🌍 Real-World Applications

Priority queues are used extensively in:

* CPU Scheduling
* Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
* Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
* Huffman Coding
* Event-Driven Simulation
* Network Routing
* Job Scheduling Systems
* Operating Systems

# 📌 Quick Reference

| Function  | Purpose                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `push()`  | Insert an element                         |
| `pop()`   | Remove the highest-priority element       |
| `top()`   | Access the highest-priority element       |
| `size()`  | Return the number of elements             |
| `empty()` | Check whether the priority queue is empty |

# 🎯 Suggested Practice

After completing this section, try implementing:

* K Largest Elements
* Merge K Sorted Arrays
* Merge K Sorted Linked Lists
* Top K Frequent Elements
* K Closest Points to Origin
* Running Median of a Stream
* Task Scheduler

These problems are frequently asked in coding interviews and highlight the strengths of priority queues.

# 📝 Key Takeaways

* `std::priority_queue` retrieves elements based on **priority**, not insertion order.
* By default, it behaves as a **Max Heap**.
* A **Min Heap** can be created using a custom comparator.
* Insertions and deletions are performed in **O(log n)** time.
* It is the preferred data structure for scheduling, shortest path algorithms, and many optimization problems.
