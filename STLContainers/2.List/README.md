# 📋 List

`std::list` is a **doubly linked list** implementation provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Unlike `std::vector`, which stores elements in contiguous memory, a list stores elements as individually allocated nodes connected through pointers.

This design makes insertion and deletion operations extremely efficient once the desired position is known, while sacrificing direct random access.

# 📄 File Overview

## `list.cpp`

This file demonstrates the core functionality of `std::list`.

### Topics Covered

* Creating lists
* Initializing with values
* `push_front()`
* `push_back()`
* `pop_front()`
* `pop_back()`
* `insert()`
* `erase()`
* Traversing using iterators
* Common member functions

The examples are designed to help you understand how linked lists behave compared to dynamic arrays.

# ⚡ Common Operations

| Operation             |      Complexity |
| --------------------- | --------------: |
| Access by index       | ❌ Not Supported |
| Front Access          |            O(1) |
| Back Access           |            O(1) |
| Insert at front       |            O(1) |
| Insert at back        |            O(1) |
| Insert using iterator |            O(1) |
| Erase using iterator  |            O(1) |
| Search                |            O(n) |

# 🔍 Vector vs List

| Feature           | `std::vector`  | `std::list`          |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Memory Layout     | Contiguous     | Non-contiguous       |
| Random Access     | ✅ O(1)         | ❌                    |
| Insert at Front   | O(n)           | O(1)                 |
| Insert at Back    | O(1) amortized | O(1)                 |
| Insert in Middle  | O(n)           | O(1) (with iterator) |
| Cache Performance | Excellent      | Lower                |

# 💡 When Should You Use a List?

Choose `std::list` when:

* Frequent insertions and deletions are required.
* Stable iterators are important.
* Random access is not needed.
* You're working with a sequence that changes often.

Avoid using `std::list` if you frequently access elements by index or need the best cache performance.

# 🌍 Real-World Applications

Doubly linked lists are useful in:

* Browser navigation (Back/Forward)
* Music playlists
* Undo/Redo systems
* LRU Cache implementations
* Task scheduling
* Text editors

# 📝 Key Takeaways

* `std::list` is implemented as a doubly linked list.
* It excels at insertion and deletion.
* It does **not** support direct indexing.
* Iterators are the primary way to traverse and modify a list.
* It trades memory efficiency and cache locality for flexibility.
